Description project:

1. Filter functionality: SORTING BY "userId", because I didn't see the "username" in the API response, but if I'm not mistaken, the functionality made will work for sorting by alfivit.
2. Adding, changing and deleting a post is done in the local store (Redux).
3. For clarity, each new post is added to the beginning of the array.
